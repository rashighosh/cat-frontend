      "briefSummary": "The goal of this randomized control trial is to determine if participating in an 8-week online cancer-related fatigue management intervention consisting of individualized exercise program, one-on-one goal setting and action plan development and interactive educational module will significantly reduce the perception of cancer-related fatigue, improve the quality of life, improve perceived cognition, and perceived function of breast cancer compared to a wait-list control group. The aim the project is to determine if an online cancerrelated fatigue management program is associated with 1. A decrease in cancer-related fatigue. 2. An improved perception of their ability and satisfaction in completing important activities 3. Greater quality of life. 4. Improved mobility 5. Improved perceived cognition"
